# rOpenSci code of conduct

The organisers of the Melbourne rOpenSci Unconference are committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Unconf participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the conference organizers.

This Code of Conduct applies to all participants, including organisers and applies to all modes of interaction, both in-person and online, including Unconf GitHub project repos and rOpenSci GitHub, the rOpenSci discussion forum, Slack channels and Twitter.

rOpenSci unconf participants agree to:

  * Be considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow attendees.
  * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; unwelcome sexual attention; deliberate 'outing' of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent; misgendering or use of 'dead' or rejected names; and publication of non-harassing private communication.
  * Take care of each other. Alert a member of the Committee if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

The rOpenSci OzUnconf18 Code of Conduct Committee includes Nick Tierney, Holly Kirk, Mathew Ling, and Saras Windecker. If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please submit a report to the Committee using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKXNapQehZXyciO8FjwXJrzrwyKVw4KBDupr7Lv2o_6bcHTQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). You may also email to the full Committee at oz-conduct [at] ropensci.org, reach out to them individually or to venue staff or security who will be present all through the event.

If any attendee engages in harassing behavior, the Committee may take any lawful action they deem appropriate, including but not limited to warning the offender or asking the offender to leave the conference. (If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating this code of conduct, you should report it with a concise description of your grievance.)

We welcome your [feedback](http://ropensci.org/contact.html) on this and every other aspect of rOpenSci's events, and we thank you for working with us to make it a safe, enjoyable, and friendly experience for everyone who participates.
